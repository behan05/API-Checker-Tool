# API Check Tool - API Documentation

Welcome to the **API Documentation** for the **API Check Tool**. Here, you'll find all the details on how to interact with the API, including the available endpoints, request/response formats, and usage examples.

---

## Base URL

All API requests are made to the following base URL:

```
http://localhost:3000/api
```

---

## Endpoints

### 1. **Test API**

- **Method**: `POST`
- **URL**: `/test`
- **Description**: Test an API endpoint by sending a request and receiving the response.

#### Request Body:

```json
{
  "url": "https://api.example.com/endpoint",
  "method": "GET",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
  },
  "body": {}
}
```
## Response:
- Success (200 OK):
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": { "response_data": "value" }
}
```
- Error (400 Bad Request):
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Invalid API endpoint or request data"
}

```

## 2. Get API Status
- Method: GET
- URL: /status
- Description: Check the status of the API server.

## Response:
Success (200 OK):

```json
{
  "status": "running",
  "uptime": "48 hours"
}

```

## Error (503 Service Unavailable):

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Service is down"
}

```

## Authentication
Some endpoints may require authentication. Use a Bearer Token in the Authorization header for secure access.

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN

```
---
## Error Codes
- 200 OK: The request was successful.
- 400 Bad Request: The request was invalid or malformed.
- 401 Unauthorized: Missing or invalid authentication token.
- 500 Internal Server Error: A server error occurred while processing the request.
---
## Rate Limiting
To ensure fair usage, the API has rate limits:
- 500 requests/hour per user
If you exceed the limit, you will receive a 429 Too Many Requests response.

## Test API Example
- Request:
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://api.example.com/endpoint", "method": "GET"}'

```

- Response:

```
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": { "response_data": "value" }
}

```
